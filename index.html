        <p> Established in 2022 at Duke University, the mission of the Association of Mixed People at Duke (AMP@D) is to build a space of community and support for Duke students who identify as multi-racial, multi-cultural, or both. </p>
        <p> We aim to help students navigate their mixed identities through social outreach activities and educational campaigns. We intend to offer a community where their identity will not be questioned, but welcomed and celebrated. Students of any multi-racial/cultural background can have the opportunity to form bonds with others who have shared similar experiences. </p> 
        <p> Although AMP@D focuses on celebrating those from mixed backgrounds, we are open to anyone interested in supporting their fellow mixed students at Duke. Through social and educational events, AMP@D is committed to providing a forum of interaction open to all interested in multiculturalism. </p>
        <p> For any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please feel free to contact us via email. </p>
